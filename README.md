## What Is Depression
Depression ```major depressive disorder``` is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.

## Why are we Depressed
Because we get a scientific writing course whose lecturers are fussy and difficult to get access from, we don't know how to write it properly. as well as the title we have to design an application that is not necessarily completed in one week.
